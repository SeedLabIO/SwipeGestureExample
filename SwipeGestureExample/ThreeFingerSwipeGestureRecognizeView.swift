    // To receive swipeWithEvent: messages, you have to ensure that the 3 finger swipe gesture is not mapped to anything that might cause a conflict. Go to System preferences -> Trackpad -> More Gestures, and set these preferences to one of the following:
    //
    // Swipe between pages:
    // - Swipe with two or three fingers, or
    // - Swipe with three fingers
    // Swipe between full-screen apps:
    // - Swipe left or right with four fingers

    override func swipeWithEvent(event: NSEvent) {
        let x = event.deltaX
        let y = event.deltaY

        if abs(x) > 0 || abs(y) > 0 {
            delegate?.hanldeSwipeWithThreeFingers(CGPointMake(x, y))
        }
    }
}
